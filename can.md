Chapter 1: Introduction and Background
1.1 The Evolution of Automotive Electronics
The modern automobile represents one of the most complex distributed computing systems in everyday use. What began in the 1970s as simple electronic fuel injection has evolved into a sophisticated network of interconnected processors, sensors, and actuators. Today's vehicles contain anywhere from thirty to over one hundred Electronic Control Units, each responsible for specific subsystems ranging from powertrain management to climate control, from advanced driver assistance systems to infotainment. This transformation has been driven by increasing demands for fuel efficiency, emissions control, safety features, and user comfort. However, this evolution has also introduced new vulnerabilities that were never anticipated when these communication protocols were first designed.
The heart of this distributed system is the Controller Area Network, commonly known as the CAN bus. Developed by Bosch in the mid-1980s and standardized in 1993 as ISO 11898, CAN was revolutionary for its time. It replaced the growing tangle of point-to-point wiring harnesses with a elegant multi-master bus topology that allowed any Electronic Control Unit to communicate with any other unit on the network. The protocol was designed for reliability in the harsh automotive environment, with robust error detection mechanisms and the ability to operate in electrically noisy conditions with temperatures ranging from negative forty to positive one hundred twenty-five degrees Celsius. The genius of CAN lies in its simplicity and its deterministic behavior, which makes it ideal for real-time control applications where timing is critical.
1.2 The Security Gap in Legacy Protocols
When Robert Bosch GmbH engineers designed the Controller Area Network in 1983, the automotive landscape was vastly different from today. Vehicles were isolated systems with no external connectivity. The idea that someone might remotely access a vehicle's internal network would have seemed like science fiction. The primary concerns were reliability, real-time performance, and cost efficiency. Security features like authentication, authorization, and encryption were not part of the design requirements because there was no threat model that required them. The engineers could not have anticipated that forty years later, vehicles would be connected to the internet through cellular modems, would communicate with smartphones via Bluetooth, and would receive over-the-air software updates.
The problem we face today is that the CAN protocol, designed in this pre-connectivity era, now forms the backbone of vehicles that are increasingly connected to external networks. Modern vehicles contain telematics units for emergency services, infotainment systems that connect to smartphones and cloud services, and wireless interfaces for keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring. Each of these connectivity points represents a potential entry vector for adversaries. Once an attacker gains access to any Electronic Control Unit connected to the CAN bus, they effectively have access to the entire vehicle network. The lack of authentication means they can impersonate any other control unit, the lack of encryption means they can read all traffic, and the broadcast nature of the bus means they can affect all systems simultaneously.
This security gap has moved from theoretical concern to demonstrated reality. Researchers have shown that it is possible to remotely compromise vehicles through vulnerabilities in cellular modems, exploit weaknesses in infotainment systems to gain CAN bus access, and inject malicious messages that can control critical safety systems like brakes and steering. These demonstrations have prompted automotive manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and security researchers to seek solutions that can retrofit security onto this legacy protocol without requiring a complete redesign of vehicle architectures.
1.3 Project Objectives and Scope
This project addresses the security challenges of the CAN protocol through a multi-faceted approach. Our primary objective is to demonstrate both the vulnerability of unprotected CAN networks and the feasibility of software-based defense mechanisms that can be deployed on resource-constrained embedded systems. Unlike many research projects that focus purely on the theoretical aspects of automotive security, we aim to create a practical, working demonstration that can be understood by engineers, students, and security professionals.
The first objective is educational. By constructing a low-cost hardware testbed using commercially available ESP32 microcontrollers and CAN transceivers, we make automotive security research accessible to a broader audience. The total hardware cost for our three-node testbed is under fifty dollars, making it affordable for universities, hobbyists, and small research labs. This democratization of automotive security research is important because it allows more people to understand these vulnerabilities and contribute to developing solutions.
The second objective is to implement and validate realistic attack scenarios. We develop what we call the "Red Team" firmware, which simulates the behavior of a compromised Electronic Control Unit that has been taken over by an adversary. Our focus is on the Denial of Service flooding attack, which is one of the most effective and difficult to defend against. This attack exploits the fundamental arbitration mechanism of CAN to monopolize the bus and prevent legitimate communications. By implementing this attack in our testbed, we can measure its effectiveness and understand its impact on network performance.
The third objective is to design and implement defensive countermeasures. We develop "Blue Team" firmware that incorporates an Intrusion Detection System capable of identifying malicious traffic in real-time. Our IDS uses a hybrid approach combining signature-based detection for known attack patterns with anomaly-based detection for unusual traffic characteristics. The challenge is to implement these detection algorithms on a microcontroller with limited processing power and memory while maintaining the real-time performance requirements of automotive systems.
The scope of this project is carefully bounded to make it achievable while still being meaningful. We focus specifically on the CAN 2.0B protocol at 500 kilobits per second, which is the standard configuration for many vehicle subsystems. We implement our system using ESP32 microcontrollers, which provide a good balance of processing power, built-in CAN controller, and low cost. We use the Rust programming language with the Embassy async framework, which provides memory safety guarantees critical for security-sensitive embedded systems. Our testbed consists of three nodes representing a simplified vehicle network, which is sufficient to demonstrate the attack and defense mechanisms while remaining manageable for a research project.
1.4 The Modern Threat Landscape for Connected Vehicles
Understanding the motivation for this project requires examining the current threat landscape for connected and autonomous vehicles. The transformation of automobiles from mechanical systems to software-defined platforms has fundamentally changed the security considerations. A modern luxury vehicle may contain over one hundred million lines of code, more than a commercial airliner or the software that powers a nuclear power plant. This complexity creates numerous opportunities for vulnerabilities.
The threat actors interested in automotive systems are diverse. Academic researchers have been at the forefront of discovering vulnerabilities, often working with manufacturers to improve security. Their work is motivated by the public interest in understanding and mitigating risks. Criminal organizations have shown interest in automotive hacking for various purposes including vehicle theft, ransomware attacks, and fraud. The traditional methods of stealing vehicles using copied key fobs have evolved into sophisticated attacks that exploit CAN bus vulnerabilities to bypass immobilizers and start engines without keys. Nation-state actors have studied automotive systems as potential targets for espionage, surveillance, and even as weapons in cyber-physical attacks. The interconnected nature of modern cities, where traffic management systems communicate with vehicles, creates new attack surfaces.
The consequences of automotive cyber attacks extend beyond financial loss or privacy concerns. Unlike traditional computer systems where a security breach might result in data theft or service disruption, attacks on vehicle networks can directly threaten human life. A successful attack that disables brakes while the vehicle is traveling at highway speeds, or one that causes sudden acceleration in heavy traffic, could result in serious injuries or fatalities. This places automotive security in a category similar to critical infrastructure protection and medical device security, where the stakes are measured in human lives rather than just dollars or data.
Regulatory responses to these threats have been evolving rapidly. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has adopted regulations requiring cybersecurity management systems for new vehicle types. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation has implications for the telemetry data that vehicles collect and transmit. In the United States, various bills have been proposed to establish cybersecurity standards for connected vehicles. These regulatory frameworks recognize that automotive cybersecurity cannot be left solely to market forces and that baseline security standards are necessary to protect public safety.

Chapter 2: The Controller Area Network Protocol - A Deep Dive
2.1 Physical Layer Architecture and Differential Signaling
To understand the vulnerabilities of the CAN protocol and how to defend against attacks, we must first thoroughly understand its operation at every layer. The physical layer of CAN is both elegant and robust, using differential signaling to achieve noise immunity that allows reliable communication in the electrically hostile environment of an automobile. Let us examine this in detail.
The physical medium of a CAN bus consists of two wires, designated CAN High and CAN Low, typically implemented as a twisted pair cable. The choice of twisted pair is not arbitrary but rather a fundamental aspect of the noise immunity strategy. When the two wires are twisted together, any electromagnetic interference from external sources such as ignition systems, alternators, or electric motors affects both wires approximately equally. Since the receiver measures the voltage difference between the two wires rather than the absolute voltage of either wire, this common-mode noise is effectively rejected.
The signaling works by manipulating the voltage levels on these two wires to represent binary data. The CAN specification defines two bus states: dominant and recessive. The dominant state, representing a logical zero, is created when the CAN transceiver drives CAN High to approximately three and a half volts and CAN Low to approximately one and a half volts. This creates a differential voltage of about two volts. The recessive state, representing a logical one, occurs when both CAN High and CAN Low are at the same voltage level, typically around two and a half volts, resulting in a differential voltage near zero.
The reason for this particular encoding scheme becomes clear when we consider what happens when multiple nodes attempt to transmit simultaneously. The CAN bus implements what is known as wired-AND logic. If one transceiver is driving the bus to the dominant state while another is allowing the bus to remain in the recessive state, the dominant state wins. This is a physical property of the electrical circuit, not something enforced by software. A recessive bit is essentially a high-impedance state where the bus is pulled to the recessive voltage by termination resistors. A dominant bit is actively driven, overriding the recessive state. This wired-AND behavior is the foundation of CAN's arbitration mechanism, which we will explore in detail later.

R = Recessive (Logic 1)
D = Dominant (Logic 0)
Bus termination is another critical aspect of the physical layer that is often overlooked but essential for reliable operation. At each physical end of the CAN bus, a one hundred twenty ohm resistor must be placed between CAN High and CAN Low. These termination resistors serve multiple purposes. First, they provide the pull to the recessive voltage level when no node is driving the bus dominant. Second, and more importantly, they prevent signal reflections that would otherwise occur when the electrical wave reaches the end of the transmission line. Without proper termination, these reflections would interfere with the transmitted signal, causing bit errors and communication failures. The value of one hundred twenty ohms is chosen to match the characteristic impedance of the twisted pair cable, typically in the range of one hundred to one hundred twenty ohms for automotive-grade CAN cables.
2.2 Data Link Layer and Frame Structure
The data link layer of CAN is where the protocol's sophisticated message-based communication paradigm is implemented. Unlike many network protocols that use address-based communication where messages are sent from one specific node to another, CAN uses a content-based addressing scheme. Each message is identified not by its source or destination, but by its content identifier. This identifier serves dual purposes: it indicates what type of information the message contains, and it determines the priority of the message on the bus.
The standard CAN frame, also known as CAN 2.0A, uses an eleven-bit identifier field. This allows for two thousand and forty-eight unique message identifiers. For applications requiring more identifiers, the extended CAN frame format, or CAN 2.0B, provides a twenty-nine-bit identifier field, supporting over five hundred million unique identifiers. In practice, most automotive applications use standard frames, reserving the extended format for specialized diagnostics or future expansion.
Let us walk through the complete structure of a standard CAN frame as it appears on the bus. The frame begins with a single dominant bit called the Start of Frame, or SOF. This bit serves to synchronize all nodes on the bus to the beginning of the new message. Following the SOF comes the arbitration field, which contains the eleven-bit identifier and a single bit called the Remote Transmission Request, or RTR. The RTR bit distinguishes between data frames, which carry payload data, and remote frames, which are requests for data. In a data frame, the RTR bit is dominant (zero), while in a remote frame it is recessive (one).
After the arbitration field comes the control field, which contains several important pieces of information. The first bit is the Identifier Extension bit, or IDE, which indicates whether this is a standard or extended frame. This is followed by a reserved bit, which must be dominant. Then comes the Data Length Code, or DLC, which is a four-bit field indicating how many bytes of data are in the payload, ranging from zero to eight bytes. The actual data field follows, containing the number of bytes specified by the DLC.
Following the data comes a fifteen-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check, or CRC, which is used to detect transmission errors. The CRC is followed by a single recessive CRC delimiter bit. Next is the ACK slot, a fascinating aspect of the CAN protocol. The transmitting node sends this bit as recessive, but any node that has correctly received the message up to this point will overwrite this bit with a dominant level, thus acknowledging successful reception. This means that the transmitter receives immediate feedback about whether at least one other node on the bus has correctly received its message. The ACK slot is followed by a recessive ACK delimiter bit.
Finally, the frame concludes with the End of Frame field, consisting of seven recessive bits, and then an Interframe Space of three recessive bits before the bus returns to the idle state and becomes available for the next transmission.
Standard CAN 2.0A Frame Structure

┌─────┬──────────────────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────┬──────┬─────┬───────┐
│ SOF │   Arbitration    │ Control │   Data   │ CRC │ ACK  │ EOF │  IFS  │
│  1  │   ID(11) + RTR   │ 6 bits  │  0-64    │ 16  │  2   │  7  │   3   │
└─────┴──────────────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴───────┘

       Priority           Payload Size      Error Check
       (Lower ID = Higher Priority)
The beauty of this frame structure is that it provides all the necessary information for reliable message-based communication while remaining compact enough for the limited bandwidth of the physical layer. At five hundred kilobits per second, the maximum data rate commonly used in automotive applications, a full eight-byte data frame requires approximately one hundred thirty bits, resulting in a transmission time of about two hundred sixty microseconds. This allows for thousands of messages per second, sufficient for real-time control applications.
2.3 The Arbitration Mechanism - Priority-Based Bus Access
Perhaps the most ingenious aspect of the CAN protocol is its arbitration mechanism, which allows multiple nodes to contend for bus access in a deterministic, collision-free manner. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for understanding both the strengths of CAN and the vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
The arbitration process begins when the bus is idle, indicated by eleven consecutive recessive bits. Any node that has a message to transmit can begin transmission by sending the Start of Frame bit. If only one node begins transmission, it proceeds without interference. However, if multiple nodes begin transmitting simultaneously, they will initially be unaware of each other's presence because they are all sending the same SOF bit.
The arbitration occurs during the transmission of the identifier field. Each transmitting node sends its identifier bit by bit, starting with the most significant bit. Simultaneously, each node monitors the bus to see what bit level is actually present. As long as a node transmits a bit and sees the same bit level on the bus, it continues transmission. However, if a node transmits a recessive bit (one) but observes a dominant bit (zero) on the bus, it knows that another node is transmitting a message with higher priority. In this case, the node immediately stops transmitting and becomes a receiver. This process continues bit by bit until only one transmitting node remains.
The critical insight is that because of the wired-AND property of the physical layer, the message with the lowest numerical identifier value will always win arbitration. A message with identifier zero x zero zero zero would have the highest possible priority and would always win arbitration against any other message. Conversely, a message with identifier zero x seven F F (in standard format) would have the lowest priority.
Let us consider a concrete example to illustrate this process. Imagine three nodes attempting to transmit simultaneously. Node A has a message with identifier zero x one two three, Node B has identifier zero x one two four, and Node C has identifier zero x one three zero. All three nodes begin transmission and send the SOF bit. They then begin sending their identifiers bit by bit. The first several bits of all three identifiers are identical, so all nodes continue transmitting. However, when they reach the eighth bit from the left (counting from the most significant bit), Node C's identifier has a one while Nodes A and B have a zero. Node C observes the dominant level on the bus and knows it has lost arbitration. It stops transmitting and becomes a receiver. Nodes A and B continue, unaware that Node C has dropped out. They continue bit by bit until they reach the last bit of the identifier field. At this point, Node A sends a one while Node B sends a zero. Node A observes the dominant level, recognizes that it has lost arbitration, and stops transmitting. Node B continues and successfully transmits its message. After Node B's message is complete, Nodes A and C can retry their transmissions.
Arbitration Example (Binary IDs shown)

Time →  Bit:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
        Bus:  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  ← Winning message
        
Node A (ID: 0x123 = 0001 0010 011): 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  1  LOSES at bit 8
Node B (ID: 0x124 = 0001 0010 010): 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  LOSES at bit 11
Node C (ID: 0x130 = 0001 0011 000): 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  X  X  LOSES at bit 9

Winner: Node C (ID: 0x130) - lowest numerical value
This arbitration mechanism has several important properties. First, it is completely deterministic. The same set of messages attempting to transmit simultaneously will always be prioritized in the same order. Second, it is non-destructive. Unlike Ethernet's CSMA/CD protocol where collisions result in corrupted frames that must be retransmitted, CAN arbitration results in the immediate successful transmission of the highest priority message with no data loss. Third, it provides bounded latency for high-priority messages. A critical safety message with a low identifier value will never wait longer than the time required to transmit one maximum-length lower-priority message before gaining bus access.
However, this elegant mechanism also creates a vulnerability that attackers can exploit. If a malicious node continuously transmits messages with identifier zero x zero zero zero, it will win every arbitration, effectively denying all other nodes access to the bus. This is the foundation of the flooding attack that we demonstrate in this project.
2.4 Error Detection and Fault Confinement Mechanisms
The CAN protocol incorporates multiple layers of error detection to ensure high reliability in noisy automotive environments. These mechanisms work together to detect transmission errors, corrupted frames, and malfunctioning nodes, automatically triggering retransmission or isolation as needed. Understanding these error detection mechanisms is essential for both implementing robust CAN systems and for understanding how they can be exploited or overwhelmed by attacks.
The first line of defense is the Cyclic Redundancy Check, which is calculated over the Start of Frame, arbitration field, control field, and data field. The transmitter calculates this fifteen-bit CRC using a standardized polynomial and includes it in the frame. Each receiver independently calculates the same CRC over the received bits and compares its calculated value with the received CRC field. Any mismatch indicates a transmission error, and the receiver will flag the error. The CRC is highly effective at detecting burst errors, random bit errors, and certain systematic errors that might result from electromagnetic interference or failing hardware.
The second error detection mechanism is bit monitoring. Every node that transmits a bit on the bus monitors the actual bus level during the bit time. If a transmitter sends a recessive bit but observes a dominant level on the bus, this indicates either that the node has lost arbitration (which is normal during the arbitration phase) or that there is a bit error (which is abnormal during the data phase). Similarly, if a node sends a dominant bit but observes a recessive level, this always indicates an error. This bit-level monitoring provides immediate error detection with no latency.
The third mechanism is bit stuffing, which serves both synchronization and error detection purposes. After any sequence of five consecutive bits of the same polarity, the transmitter automatically inserts a bit of the opposite polarity. Receivers expect this stuffing and automatically remove these bits. If a receiver detects six consecutive bits of the same polarity, it knows that a stuff error has occurred, either due to a transmission error or because the stuff bit was itself corrupted. This mechanism ensures that there are frequent bit transitions to maintain synchronization between all nodes, and it provides an additional layer of error detection.
Beyond detecting individual frame errors, CAN implements a sophisticated fault confinement mechanism that prevents a single malfunctioning node from disrupting the entire network. Every CAN controller maintains two error counters: the Transmit Error Counter, or TEC, and the Receive Error Counter, or REC. These counters are incremented when errors are detected and decremented when successful transmissions or receptions occur, with different weights for different types of errors.
When a node successfully transmits a message, its TEC is decremented. When a node successfully receives a message, its REC is decremented. However, when errors occur, the counters are incremented by larger amounts. A node that detects an error in a message it is receiving increments its REC by one. A node that detects an error in a message it is transmitting increments its TEC by eight. This asymmetry is intentional: it is designed to isolate transmitters that are consistently sending corrupted frames more quickly than receivers that might just be experiencing noisy conditions.
Based on these error counter values, a node can be in one of three states. The error active state is the normal operating state where error counters are below certain thresholds and the node can transmit and receive normally. If either error counter exceeds one hundred twenty-seven, the node enters the error passive state. In this state, the node can still transmit and receive, but it signals errors differently and must wait longer before attempting to retransmit after an error. This prevents an error-passive node from immediately disrupting retransmissions by other nodes. If the TEC exceeds two hundred fifty-five, the node enters the bus-off state and disconnects itself from the bus entirely. This prevents a severely malfunctioning node from completely disrupting network communication.
This fault confinement mechanism is generally effective at isolating hardware failures or nodes experiencing electrical problems. However, it can be overwhelmed by deliberate attacks. A malicious node that floods the bus with high-priority messages is behaving correctly from the CAN controller's perspective—it is winning arbitration legitimately and transmitting valid frames. The other nodes on the bus, which are losing arbitration repeatedly, may actually enter error-passive or even bus-off states because they interpret their arbitration losses as transmission errors. This inverted response, where the legitimate nodes are penalized while the attacker continues operating normally, makes the flooding attack particularly effective and difficult to counter using only the protocol's built-in mechanisms.

Chapter 3: Security Vulnerabilities in Automotive Networks
3.1 The Absence of Authentication and Authorization
The most fundamental security weakness of the CAN protocol is its complete lack of authentication mechanisms. In modern security terminology, the CAN bus implements no concepts of identity, authentication, or authorization. Any node on the bus can send any message with any identifier at any time, and receiving nodes have no way to verify the source of a message or determine whether the sender is authorized to transmit that particular message type.
To understand the severity of this vulnerability, consider a typical automotive application. A modern vehicle might have an Engine Control Unit that sends periodic messages with identifier zero x zero A zero, containing information about engine RPM, coolant temperature, and throttle position. The instrument cluster receives these messages and displays the information to the driver. Other systems, such as the transmission control unit and the stability control system, also use this information for their control algorithms. Now imagine that an adversary has compromised the infotainment system and gained the ability to send arbitrary CAN messages. The attacker can send messages with identifier zero x zero A zero containing false information. Perhaps the attacker sends messages indicating that the engine is overheating when it is not, or that the throttle is fully closed when the driver is actually accelerating. The receiving Electronic Control Units have no way to distinguish these malicious messages from legitimate ones. There is no digital signature, no encryption, no identity field that they can check. They will process the false data as if it were genuine.
The consequences of this authentication gap extend beyond simple data spoofing. In many vehicles, certain CAN messages trigger immediate physical actions. A message with a specific identifier might command the brake actuators to apply braking force, or command the electronic power steering to adjust assist levels, or command door lock actuators to engage. If an attacker can send these command messages, they can directly control critical vehicle functions. This is not theoretical—multiple research teams have demonstrated these attacks on production vehicles, showing that remote adversaries can disable brakes, apply unexpected acceleration, or disable critical safety systems.
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the design philosophy of the original CAN specification. When CAN was designed in the 1980s, the assumption was that all nodes on the bus were trusted. The network was physically isolated within the vehicle, and there was no concept of external connectivity. The designers focused on reliability, real-time performance, and cost efficiency. Adding authentication would have required additional message overhead, potentially complex cryptographic operations that would be expensive to implement in the microcontrollers of that era, and key management infrastructure that would add complexity to vehicle manufacturing and service. These were considered unacceptable costs for a threat that did not exist at the time.
Today, we face the difficult challenge of retrofitting security onto this legacy protocol. Various approaches have been proposed, including message authentication codes appended to CAN frames, intrusion detection systems that analyze traffic patterns, and hardware firewalls that segment the network. Each approach involves tradeoffs between security, performance, backwards compatibility, and cost. Our project explores the intrusion detection approach, which can be implemented in software without requiring changes to existing Electronic Control Units or the CAN protocol itself.
3.2 The Lack of Confidentiality and Privacy Implications
Closely related to the authentication problem is the complete absence of encryption in the CAN protocol. Every message transmitted on the CAN bus is sent in plaintext, with no confidentiality protection whatsoever. Any node on the bus can receive and read every message, including messages not intended for it. In many vehicles, even the OBD-II diagnostic port provides direct access to read all CAN traffic, requiring no special tools beyond a simple CAN interface adapter.
The implications for privacy and security are significant. Consider the wealth of information that can be gleaned from CAN traffic. Vehicle speed is transmitted continuously, allowing an attacker to track the driver's movements and determine when the vehicle is traveling and when it is parked. GPS coordinates are often transmitted on the CAN bus by navigation systems. Door lock status, window positions, seatbelt usage, airbag readiness—all of this information is available in plaintext to anyone with physical access to the bus. In modern vehicles with cellular connectivity, if an attacker can compromise the telematics unit, they can remotely monitor all of this information without ever physically approaching the vehicle.
Beyond privacy concerns, the lack of encryption facilitates other attacks. Replay attacks become trivial when messages are unencrypted. An attacker can record a sequence of messages that perform some action, such as unlocking the doors or disabling the alarm system, and then replay these messages at a later time to repeat the action. Reverse engineering vehicle networks becomes much easier when all traffic is visible. Security researchers have published extensive databases of CAN message identifiers and their meanings for various vehicle models, information that was gathered simply by observing plaintext traffic.
Some might argue that encryption would be unnecessary overhead for a network that is supposedly physically isolated. However, as we have discussed, modern vehicles are no longer isolated. They have multiple external interfaces, and any of these can serve as an entry point for attackers. The infotainment system might have vulnerabilities in its web browser or Bluetooth stack. The cellular modem might be exploitable through malformed data packets. The wireless tire pressure monitoring system might use weak encryption that can be broken. Once an attacker penetrates any of these external interfaces and gains a foothold on a connected Electronic Control Unit, the lack of CAN encryption gives them full visibility into all vehicle systems.
Implementing encryption on CAN faces similar challenges to implementing authentication. The bandwidth is limited, and encryption would add overhead to every message. The microcontrollers in many existing Electronic Control Units may lack the processing power to perform encryption in real-time while maintaining their control loop timing requirements. Key management presents significant challenges: how would encryption keys be provisioned during vehicle manufacturing, how would they be managed during the vehicle's lifetime, how would service technicians gain access to encrypted communications during repairs? Despite these challenges, several research groups and industry consortia are developing solutions, including the AUTOSAR Secure Onboard Communication specification and various lightweight cryptographic schemes designed specifically for automotive networks.
3.3 The Broadcast Topology and Network Segmentation Issues
The third fundamental security weakness of CAN networks is the broadcast topology combined with the lack of network segmentation. In CAN, every message is received by every node on the bus. There is no concept of unicast or point-to-point communication at the protocol level. When a node transmits a message, it is simultaneously received by all other nodes. Each node uses hardware acceptance filters to ignore messages it does not need, but the messages are still physically present on the bus and consume bandwidth.
From a security perspective, this broadcast topology creates several problems. First, it means that a single compromised node can affect the entire network. If one Electronic Control Unit is taken over by an attacker, that node can transmit malicious messages that are received by all other nodes. There is no way to isolate the compromised node or limit the scope of its communications without physically disconnecting it from the bus.
Second, the broadcast topology amplifies the impact of denial-of-service attacks. A flooding attack that saturates the bus prevents all legitimate communications across the entire network. It is not possible to maintain critical communications on one part of the network while isolating the attacked portion, as one might do with a switched Ethernet network or segmented network topology. When the bus is saturated, all systems are affected simultaneously.
Third, the lack of segmentation makes it difficult to implement security zones or trust boundaries within the vehicle network. In modern IT security, the principle of network segmentation is used to limit the impact of compromises. For example, a corporate network might segment the guest WiFi network from the internal business network, so that a compromised guest device cannot access sensitive internal systems. In a vehicle, we might want to segment the infotainment system, which has external interfaces and runs complex software vulnerable to compromise, from the critical safety systems like brakes and airbags. However, if these systems are all on the same CAN bus, they can all communicate directly with each other, and the compromise of the infotainment system immediately provides access to the safety-critical systems.
Some modern vehicles do implement multiple separate CAN buses to provide some degree of segmentation. A typical configuration might have a powertrain CAN bus for engine and transmission control, a chassis CAN bus for suspension and braking systems, a comfort CAN bus for climate control and seating, and an infotainment CAN bus for entertainment and navigation systems. These separate buses are connected through gateway Electronic Control Units that can filter messages and control which information flows between buses. This provides some security benefit, but it is not a complete solution. The gateway itself becomes a critical security component that must be carefully designed and protected. If the gateway is compromised, the attacker gains access to all connected networks. Additionally, many vehicles have complex interconnections between systems that require information to flow across these boundaries, creating potential attack paths.
Our demonstration system, like many actual vehicle networks, consists of a single CAN bus with all nodes connected. This represents the worst-case scenario from a security perspective but is actually quite common in real vehicles, particularly in less expensive models or in vehicles from earlier generations when network segmentation was not a significant concern.
